 1. Symmetric Distribution (No Skewness)
Mean = Median = Mode

📉 2. Left-Skewed Distribution (Negatively Skewed)
Tail is on the left (more low values)

Relationship:


Mean < Median < Mode
🔍 Explanation:
The mean gets pulled in the direction of the tail (left), so it becomes less than the median and mode.

📈 3. Right-Skewed Distribution (Positively Skewed)
Tail is on the right (more high values)

Relationship:



Mode < Median < Mean
🔍 Explanation:
The mean is pulled to the right due to higher values, so it becomes greater than the median and mode.
